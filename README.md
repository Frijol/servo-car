servo-car
=========

Basic control API for a two-servo car-like robot.

This library is an abstraction for driving a car which has two servos as its controls (e.g. a Sumobot).

Be sure to calibrate your servos according to the [calibration instructions](https://github.com/tessel/servo-pca9685/blob/master/examples/calibrate.js).
